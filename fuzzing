# Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, 
or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, 
or failing built-in code assertions or for finding potential memory leaks. Typically, fuzzers are used to 
test programs that take structured inputs.
