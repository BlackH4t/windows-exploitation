# windows exploitation
An exploit (from the English verb to exploit, meaning "to use something to oneâ€™s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack.

## Fuzzing :
Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected,
or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, 
or failing built-in code assertions or for finding potential memory leaks. Typically, fuzzers are used to 
test programs that take structured inputs.
